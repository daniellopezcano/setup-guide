When configuring shell environments for both local and remote machines, understanding how **login** and **non-login shells** work is crucial to avoid issues like skipped configurations or infinite loops. Here's a compact explanation:
#### The Problem
- **Login Shells**: These are initiated when logging in to a system (e.g., via SSH). The system executes `.profile` (or equivalent) to set up the user environment. On remote machines, this behavior is default.
- **Non-Login Shells**: These are created when opening a new terminal session locally. They execute `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, skipping `.profile`.
- **The Conflict**: Mixing login and non-login logic can lead to:
  1. Missing configurations if `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` isnâ€™t properly called.
  2. Infinite loops if `.profile` or `.zshrc` sources each other repeatedly.
#### The Solution
To ensure compatibility and consistency:
1. **Use Conditional Sourcing**:
   - Avoid re-executing `.profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc` within the same session by setting environment flags (e.g., `PROFILE_ALREADY_SOURCED`).
   - Ensure each file detects if it is running in an **interactive shell** before proceeding.
2. **Switch to Zsh Explicitly (if needed)**:
   - For remote environments where the default shell is Bash, configure `.profile` to switch to Zsh explicitly:
     ```bash
     if [ -n "$(command -v zsh)" ] && [ -z "$ZSH_VERSION" ]; then
         exec zsh -l
     fi
     ```
   - This ensures `.zshrc` is executed correctly after login.
3. **Handle Missing Commands Gracefully**:
   - Use `command -v` to check if a program exists before calling it, preventing errors for missing utilities:
     ```bash
     if command -v lesspipe &> /dev/null; then
         eval "$(lesspipe)"
     else
         echo "[WARN] lesspipe not found. Skipping..."
     fi
     ```
#### Key Takeaways
- **For Local Machines**: Non-login shells execute `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` directly, so `.profile` is rarely needed.
- **For Remote Machines**: Login shells require `.profile` to initialize the environment, but `.zshrc` must still be executed for Zsh configurations. Explicitly switching to Zsh resolves this.
- **Consistency**: Using flags to prevent redundant sourcing and conditional logic for shell types ensures the same files work seamlessly in both local and remote environments.

This setup ensures robust and error-free shell initialization, regardless of the machine or login method.

| **When it runs**         | In non-login interactive shells.                              | In login shells.                                            | In interactive Zsh shells.                                   |
| **Purpose**              | Shell-specific configuration (aliases, functions).            | Environment variables and global configuration.             | Zsh-specific configuration (aliases, plugins, themes).       |
| **Automatic invocation** | Automatically invoked by Bash.                                | Invoked once at login.                                      | Automatically invoked by Zsh at startup.                     |
| **Compatibility**        | Exclusive to Bash or similar shells.                          | Used by classic and modern shells.                          | Exclusive to Zsh.                                            |
| **Description**          | Configuration file to customize Bash.                         | Global configuration file for the user.                     | Main configuration file for Zsh.                             |
| **Utility**              | Defines aliases, functions, and Bash shell-specific settings. | Sets global environment variables and loads configurations. | Defines themes, plugins, and advanced Zsh-specific settings. |
