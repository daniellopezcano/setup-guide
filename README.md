# Installation Setup & Coding Guides

## **Objective**
This repository serves as a comprehensive manual for setting up development environments and configuring tools from scratch. It is designed to guide developers and researchers through key processes such as installing Linux (Debian), configuring advanced terminal tools, setting up Python environments, automating system monitoring, installation of CUDA for ML applications, and optimizing workflows with VS Code and Jupyter.

The guides are written in Markdown and are best viewed using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a tool that allows seamless linking and navigation between files.
